MedCommons Cloud Viewer 2010
=======

MedCommons is a Cloud Radiology service which has been operational since 2006. 
The MedCommons Cloud Viewer provides access to a patient's MRI, CT Scans, and other DICOM based imaging on an iPad.

The app was written as a hybrid Native and Web app by B Donner and J Pusey, using large chunks of javascript previously written by S Sadedin for other MedCommons viewers.

This app will build and run, but only shows radiology when connected to the MedCommons Service.
